# Building for Electron

* Follow directions to create a production build, and build with `make release`
* Run `make electron`
* In `electron` directory run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run package`
* Run `npm run make`
* Binaries will be in `electron/out` (note this will only create binaries for current operating system / platform)
