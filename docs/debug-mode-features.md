# Debug Mode Features

When running the app in debug mode (this happens when you just run `make` or run in fastcgi mode with PHP), certain extra debugging features are enabled. They include:

* Timing for dither and color quantization algorithms (printed to console)
* Print palette button (located underneath color dither colors). It prints out the current hex values of the color palette to the console, useful when adding to or editing built-in color palettes
